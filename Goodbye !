Hello, 

i wont really be active for a while or permanently off pony town. 
recently some things have happened and have been triggering relapses for me. 

its been happening for a while but its reached a breaking point as it ha d gotten really bad and i had acted on bad thoughts.

so for well my own safety im trying to leave it all behind and move on with my life out side of this app. 

the memories are harmful to me and i can no longer stay around as my health continues to deteriorate. 

i am greatful for all the wonderful friends i had made on here. and really i thank you all for your support within the time you've known me. 

long term or short. i'll still be somewhat active on discord but i'll only really be accepting reqs from friends.

please remember i love you all /p.
