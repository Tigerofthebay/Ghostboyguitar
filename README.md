Okay this note was made for the purpose of defending myself as against my wishes im being brought into drama i do not wish to  be in or mentioned in and being accused of harrasment for defending myself after i was continueously mentioned against my wishes and accused of manipulation in a situation i had no part in.

Saffron- for the love of god stop mentioning me. I politely asked for you to refrain from it and it was the only words said towards you during this entire situation.

i have done nothing but defend myself this entire time and insist on you both to stop mentioning me. 

i will not fogive a person who cannot even own up to every action towards me.
i have been TRYING to move on with my life but every single week like clockwork atleast one of you spawn to make my life harder.

and again, it is not "taking responsibity" if you cannot handle the full weight and  actually properly apologize.

idgaf abt ts and i dislike that it keeps coming back. 

so please stop bringing yourselves into my life because it has nothing to do with you, and stop bringing me into your bullshit 

you could kill eachother for all i care jst leave me tf out or i will indeed start up again.

if your "admittance" and "apologies" are just going to turn into waterdowned pity parties to make urself feel better without having any actual meaning or fully admitting and apologizing for what you have done 

then by all means keep it to yourself because i wont entertain bullshit

i will defend myself if i am mentioned,so please keep your harrasment claims to urself when i do 

i am over this drama and id wish some of you would get the hint because i keep having to remove your comments
do not bring me into anything because i sure as hell had nothing to do with wtv is going on rn

i didnt try change anyones mind, i didnt yell at anyone for being friends, i kept my feelings to MYSELF and considering you where the one so desperate to know if i was mad or not idk why youre crying about it now??

i kept to myself and i removed myself from this situation before it even started. i am not tied to anything anyone else says on this because theyre making their own choices, no input from me whatsoever. i have a right to distance myself ! that was my choice! i wasnt "intentionlly trying to hurt" anyone, i was trying to keep MY peace. 

so no i didnt target anyone, i didnt harass them and i certainly didnt blow up on anyone for being friends so  stop bringing me into it 


please stop with your comments on my ata. harassing me doesnt make you better in any way.

and stop inserting me in this drama without understanding my side

prior to this even happening i was upset with saffron for many reasons and i distanced myself from him because he was acting off and it made me uncomfy.

but instead of giving me my space i was constantly bothered. i could not go a DAY by myself. despite knowing i wasnt in the mood and me asking to be left alone they would not leave me alone and just bugged me with questions for spacing myself

i NEVER said i was upset over him and soap being friends, he knew i was upset with him and just assumed that is was about that. i didnt tell ANYONE why i was upset with him i just removed myself from near him

the only input from me during his entire thing was me defending myself and asking to stop being mentioned. as well as confronting him on things he had said. 

stop inserting me into this situation that you created yourselves please. 

i am not obligated to forgive or like anyone. and being inlcuded in this just because i wanted some space and time to myself is actually absurd.
