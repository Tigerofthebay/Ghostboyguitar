Okay this note was made for the purpose of defending myself as against my wishes im being brought into drama i do not wish to  be in or mentioned in and being accused of harrasment for defending myself after i was continueously mentioned against my wishes and accused of manipulation in a situation i had no part in.

Saffron- for the love of god stop mentioning me. I politely asked for you to refrain from it and it was the only words said towards you during this entire situation.

As for "throwing words around" i dont know what amount of asskissing is going on here but i had already opened up to you about the manipulation i faced from soap and EXPLAINED what happened. Not only that as well as proof of him guiltripping me. Which i had shown you btw but heres a short  trip down memory lane

I opened up to you about BOTH soap and his ex gaslighting and lying to me as well as guiltripping
THAT is manipulation. 

Soap continuously lied to me on several occasions saying that his ex contacted him and then had me contact their ex and tell them to stop. Tho i never mentioned it to soap, sleepy had SHOWN me proof that he didnt do what soap said  and  that soap was the one contacting him, soap never admitted to it and kept the lie up and i never confronted him about it. 

Some of the proof of this i STILL HAVE.

I opened up to you about the manipulation i faced from both sides and how they always put me in the middle of their issues.

THAT is why he was being called manipulative. 

And since you want to talk about "throwing words around" you are accusing of manipulating keegan despite the fact i never spoke to them about this situation. At all. 
 They made a choice on their own and off their own feelings which they opened up about.  And you are blaming me for them choosing to distance from you. 

You know it well that you where the one who escalated this situation.

I am only defending myself  abt the things being said abt me and confronting about it. 

This will be the last time i ask. Stop bringing me into this
