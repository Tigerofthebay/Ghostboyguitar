Saffron let me be the first to tell you youre actually unhinged

nobody was dogpiling you
ill say it again NO ONE was doing that

you got called out on your actions and your hypocrisy
you lecture everyone about morals and respect  yet you are the one who never follows it

and about suicide and "mental ruin"
when we werent speaking and i was begging you to take down my vents with my overdose you refused
it took us being friends again and me asking for the THIRTEENTH time for you to finally remove it

you weaponize other peoples pain because it is easier to point fingers than to look in a mirror

you cant admit anything and you cant apologize and that already tells the whole story

and when you say "ive done some things" you really mean the same shit you keep doing now

grow a spine

youre actually such a spineless jackass

and the way you highlight out "friends" when you have been an ass to everyone around you is rich
Esp the ones who spent hours a day trying to help you heal from the very shit you ran back to. 

no real friend would SEE you doing smt they think isnt right and not feel somewhat upset or uncomfy.
that is one of the most ridiculous expectation you set on others.

you ignored and shit talked and straight up mistreated one of us for talking to the exact same person you would spend most of your day shitting on

but when it was our turn to be upset or uncomfortable oh no saint saffron was suddenly untouchable

this blew up solely because of you and soap
mowie never said anything to you until you yelled at him for taking a step back

the only time i called you out directly was when you wheres spreading  bullshit about me manipulating keegan and blamed me for keegan not talking to you

where was your sympathy when i was struggling
where was the decency when i begged you to remove my vents and to stop making fun of them
i was the one struggling and you labeled me as victimizing myself because you undermine everyone but you
to you no ones problems matter except your own

your only compassion is your own issues.

no one forced you to stop talking to him
you made it into a whole situation and then blew up at everyone who disagreed with your choice

you created and escalated this mess

and soap is useless in all this because he could not keep me out of anything if his life depended on it and before you say "dont involve him" he involved himself

you constantly water down what others went through no matter which side experienced it

you will always name one person the villain and minimize their mental health and trauma

that never applies to you of course

you must have been craving my attention because you cannot keep my name out of your mouth ever and this isnt new

since the start ive been hearing ridiculous lies about me

you are running from accountability so hard it is embarrassing

do not lecture me about boundaries or respect when you have neither unless it benefits you

you couldnt respect my boundaries enough to not leak my face behind my back despite knowing how badly it triggered the paranoia of that was for me

you have never respected a single boundary i set since day one

But you want me to do it for you?

This 40/60 is Not Working at all.
