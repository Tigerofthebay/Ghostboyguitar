Okay this note was made for the purpose of defending myself as against my wishes im being brought into drama i do not wish to  be in or mentioned in and being accused of harrasment for defending myself after i was continueously mentioned against my wishes and accused of manipulation in a situation i had no part in.

Saffron- for the love of god stop mentioning me. I politely asked for you to refrain from it and it was the only words said towards you during this entire situation.

i have done nothing but defend myself this entire time and insist on you both to stop mentioning me. 

i will not fogive a person who cannot even own up to every action towards me.
i have been TRYING to move on with my life but every single week like clockwork atleast one of you spawn to make my life harder.

and again, it is not "taking responsibity" if you cannot handle the full weight and  actually properly apologize.

idgaf abt ts and i dislike that it keeps coming back. 

so please stop bringing yourselves into my life because it has nothing to do with you, and stop bringing me into your bullshit 

you could kill eachother for all i care jst leave me tf out or i will indeed start up again.

if your "admittance" and "apologies" are just going to turn into waterdowned pity parties to make urself feel better without having any actual meaning or fully admitting and apologizing for what you have done 

then by all means keep it to yourself because i wont entertain bullshit

i will defend myself if i am mentioned,so please keep your harrasment claims to urself when i do 

i am over this drama and id wish some of you would get the hint because i keep having to remove your comments
do not bring me into anything because i sure as hell had nothing to do with wtv is going on rn
